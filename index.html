    <strong>If you are unsure of which version to get, then I recommend buying it from <a href="https://zylinski.itch.io/odinbook">Itch</a>.</strong> On Itch you get both the HTML and eBook versions. So it's a better deal. Also if you're interested in supporting me: On Itch I get 90% of the money, on Amazon I only get 35%. You can read the eBook version from Itch on your Kindle by sending it to your <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle/email">send-to-kindle email address</a>.
