    The Odin Programming Language is a powerful yet simple programming language. It can be used to create many kinds of programs, be they high-performance desktop applications, video games or utilities.
</p>

<p>
    This book teaches basic things, such as how variables work and how to create new types. It also goes into more advanced concepts, such as manual memory management, parametric polymorphism and data-oriented design. <strong>A programming language is a tool. By deeply understanding your tools, you will become a better craftsperson.</strong> Therefore, on top of how to write Odin code, this book also provides explanations of why things work they way they do.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>target audience</strong> is anyone with some basic programming experience. You may have used a high-level language such as Python, C# or JavaScript before, or you may have have used a low-level language such as C or C++. Regardless, this book is for you.
