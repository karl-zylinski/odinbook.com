<p>
    <strong>Understanding the Odin Programming Language</strong> is a book that teaches basic things, such as how variables work and how to create new types. It also goes into more advanced concepts, such as <strong>manual memory management</strong>, parametric polymorphism and data-oriented design.
</p>
<p>A programming language is a tool. <strong>By understanding your tools, you will become a better craftsperson</strong>. Therefore, on top of how to write Odin code, this book also provides explanations of why things work they way they do.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>target audience</strong> is anyone with some basic programming experience. You may have used a high-level language such as Python, C# or JavaScript before, or you may have have used a low-level language such as C or C++. Regardless, this book is for you.
