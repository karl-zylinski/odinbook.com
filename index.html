    <em>Understanding the Odin Programming Language</em> is a book that teaches both basic and advanced Odin concepts. You'll learn about procedures, <strong>manual memory management</strong>, parametric polymorphism, data-oriented design, and much more.
</p>

<p>
    The target audience is anyone with some programming experience. Odin is a simple yet powerful language, making this book a <strong>great introduction to low-level programming</strong>, regardless of your background.
</p>

<p>
    A programming language is a tool. <strong>By understanding your tools, you will become a better craftsperson</strong>. Therefore, this book does not just explain how to write Odin code. It also explains <em>why</em> the language works the way it does.

    I never read, I get distracted easily. But the writing style here is so good, that I didn't have any issues reading through the whole thing in a couple days. -<strong>Review on store.zylinski.se by Shaka</strong>.
