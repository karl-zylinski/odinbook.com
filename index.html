<p class="top">
The Odin Programming Language is <strong>powerful yet simple</strong>. It can be used to create many kinds of programs, be they high-performance desktop applications, video games or utilities.
</p>

<p>
This book teaches basic things, such as how variables work and how to create new types. It also goes into more advanced concepts, such as <strong>manual memory management</strong>, parametric polymorphism and data-oriented design.
</p>

<p>
A programming language is a tool. <strong>By understanding your tools, you will become a better craftsperson</strong>. Therefore, on top of how to write Odin code, this book also provides explanations of why things work the way they do.
</p>

The <strong>target audience</strong> is anyone with some basic programming experience. You may have used a high-level language such as Python, C# or JavaScript before, or you may have have used a low-level language such as C or C++. Regardless, this book is for you.
